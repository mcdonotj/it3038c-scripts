PROJECT 2 READ ME

IN THIS PROJECT I WANTED TO BEGIN CREATING A WEB APPLICATION FOR A DND SIMULATOR
IN ORDER TO DO THIS ON YOUR DEVICE FIRST DOWNLOAD THE PROJECT2-3.JS FILE TO YOUR LINUX DEVICE
THEN IN TERMINAL TYPE 'NODE PROJECT2-3.JS'
TERMINAL WILL SAY LISTENING ON PORT 3000, THIS MEANS THE SERVER IS UP!
NEXT GO TO A WEB BROWSER AND TYPE http://localhost:3000/
YOU WILL THEN BE DIRECTED TO THE SIMULATOR WHERE YOU CAN SEE AND SELECT YOUR CHARACTER!
